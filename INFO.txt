FIFA 21 DATASET

Task: Given a very dirty dataset containing data on all available players in the FIFA 21 game, my task was to simply clean the data, and to do this utilized only Microsoft Excel and took the following steps, to mention a few

1. Loaded the data with Power Query to automatically clean all the unwanted characters, text and symbols
2. Converted Age, Height, Weight, Player Value, Wage and Release Clause columns to Numerical as well as other columns to their relevant data type for analysis 
3. Properly formatted all the currency columns to â‚¬ for analysis
4. Used find and replace to remove the star symbol from W/F, S/M and I/R columns 
5. Split Team and Contract columns into Team, Contract Start and Contract Finish 

The Summarized Visualizations included:
1. Total Value of Players
2. Total Number of Players
3. Average Wage 
4. Average Age
5. Highest Payed Player
6. Most Valued Player
7. Highest Release Clause
8. Summarized visualizations of Players Nationality and their given age-distribution
